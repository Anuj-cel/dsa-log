Problem Name
3634. Minimum Removals to Balance Array
🔗 Platform: LeetCode
⭐ Difficulty: Medium



You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
An array is considered balanced if the value of its maximum element is at most k times the minimum element.
You may remove any number of elements from nums​​​​​​​ without making it empty.
Return the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is balanced.
Note: An array of size 1 is considered balanced as its maximum and minimum are equal, and the condition always holds true.
Key Observation
Sliding Window / Two Pointers

Final Solution (C++)
class Solution {
public:
    int minRemoval(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        int l = 0;
        int maxLen = 1;

        for (int r = 0; r < nums.size(); r++) {
            while ((long long)nums[r] > (long long)nums[l] * k) {
                l++;
            }
            maxLen = max(maxLen, r - l + 1);
        }

        return nums.size() - maxLen;
    }
};

Time & Space Complexity
Time: O(n log n) (sorting + linear scan)
Space: O(1) (ignoring sort space)
